## About
This is an elegant, minimal portfolio website for a professional beauty retoucher.

The main point of the site is to display high-quality images to the potential clients. Therefore, our biggest concern is loading time increased by the size of the pictures.  Lazyload library let's us show the low-quality versions of the images while the full image (That is also compressed) is being loaded.

There are some custom-written features like a reversed slider that starts on the pre-last slide, magnetic button that focuses user's attention on it's content (the email) and cursor replaced by a css shape.

SVG is being used throughout the project so user experience feels more smooth. If user's browser does not support SVG we automatically switch to PNG.

The website is also responsive and all of the features are mobile-friendly.
